# Clicks n Clicks
*Welcome to my tiny clicker game. The rules are very simple,
                just click on the buttons to gain points. Different buttons give you different points.
                In order to get acces to higher click scores you will first need to purchase the upgrade.
                Purchasing an upgrade is simple! Just click on the 'Purchase?' text
                that you see on the left side. 
                You can also unlock auto-generated points. Basically you get clicks without"
                 actually clicking. Sounds cool, right? You get those by matching your
                 mouse pointer with the '++' button
                Create your user and after that you are ready to go on a clicking journey... 
                 Don't forget to click and have fun exploring my game :)*

I have created this game by using C# Windows Application Forms. The game is pretty easy to understand, just click like a mad man on the buttons to increase your score. I added a start menu page where you can create an user, read how the game works and then start the clicking. I also added a label that keeps the count of how many times you clicked.
I Will definitely add more features to it and do my best to improve my mini game.


Have a peak on how it looks so far:The Main Menu:
