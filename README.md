# Clicks n Clicks
Clicker game that I created using C# Windows Application Forms. The game is pretty easy to understand, just click like a mad man on the buttons to increase your score. I added a start menu page where you can create an user, read how the game works and then start the clicking. I also added a label that keeps the count of how many times you clicked
I Will definitely add more features to it and do my best to improve my mini game.


Have a peak on how it looks so far:\
